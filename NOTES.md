## Assigment: Build-A-Blog - Frontend

This week's assignment is to build a React app for a blog.

Your blog display needs a:
  - header,
  - main content area, and
  - footer.

Your main content area needs to have a:
  - main area for actual content and
  - at least one sidebar.

Your site also needs a:
  - navigation bar that takes users to:
    - blog posts,
    - about page, and a
    - recommended links links page.

Your blog posts should include a:
  - date-time entry and
  - tags.

Your sidebar should include a:
  - list of months when a blog entry has been made, along with a
  - list of tags used on blogs.
  - Clicking on a month or tag should show a:
    - filtered list of blog entries.

The initial working version is due by Wednesday evening.
